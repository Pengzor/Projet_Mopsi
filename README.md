# Puzzle Solving interface

The aim of this app is to solve polyominos pavement problem of size NxN, for N = 3,4,5,6,7 ; with and additional constraint of a fixed "bloc" of size 1x1. The solvers were developped for the MoPSi project and the API for the TDLog project from the respective ENPC courses.
